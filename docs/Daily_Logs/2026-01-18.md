## 📝 Summary
Major infrastructure upgrade day. We moved from Llama 3.2 (3B) to **Llama 3.1 (8B)** for better reasoning and replaced the failing Coqui TTS with **Piper TTS** for speed and Indian accent support. We also implemented true **Multilingual (Tanglish)** support.

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- [x] **TTS Engine Swap**: Replaced Coqui XTTS (Python dependency hell) with Piper (Standalone Binary).
- [x] **Voice Model**: Downloaded `te_IN-maya-medium.onnx` to provide a natural Indian English accent.
- [x] **Brain Transplant**: Upgraded `core/brain.py` to use `llama3.1:8b`.
- [x] **Multilingual Ears**: Added "Context Priming" to Whisper in `core/adaptive_asr.py` to support phrases like *"Firefox open pannu"*.
- [x] **Tanglish Router**: Updated `core/router.py` regex to handle SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) sentence structures.
- [x] **Documentation**: Complete rewrite of the docs into an Obsidian-ready Knowledge Base.

## 🚧 In Progress / Blockers
- **Vision**: Relying on Cloud (Gemini 2.0). Need to investigate `Llava` or `BakLLaVA` for local v2.0 update.
- **TTS Language**: Piper currently only speaks English phrases (with an accent). It cannot read native Tamil script yet.

## 🧠 Decisions Made
- **Decision**: Dropped the "AI Router" (BERT) in favor of **Regex**.
    - *Reasoning*: The AI router added ~600ms latency. Regex is instant. We prioritized "Snappiness" over flexibility.
- **Decision**: Used `te_IN` (Telugu) model for TTS instead of training a new one.
    - *Reasoning*: It was the best available "Indian English" proxy that was lightweight and high-quality.
