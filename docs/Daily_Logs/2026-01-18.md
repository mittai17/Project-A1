# 📅 Daily Log: 2026-01-18

## 📝 Summary
Major infrastructure upgrades today. **XTTS v2 voice cloning** is now integrated! We also migrated to **Python 3.11** via pyenv to support the TTS library.

---

## 🌟 XTTS v2 Integration (NEW)

### Environment Changes
- [x] Installed `pyenv` for Python version management
- [x] Built and installed **Python 3.11.11** (required for TTS)
- [x] Created new virtual environment with Python 3.11
- [x] Installed `TTS 0.22.0` (Coqui XTTS v2)

### Code Changes
- [x] **`core/speak.py`**: Dual-engine TTS system
  - XTTS v2 for English (voice cloning from `speaker.wav`)
  - Piper TTS fallback for Tamil and fallback scenarios
  - Added `soundfile` for audio loading
  - Interruption handling for both engines

### Documentation
- [x] `Core/Core_TTS.md` — Complete rewrite
- [x] `Guides/XTTS_Setup.md` — **NEW** voice cloning guide
- [x] `Operations/Installation.md` — Added pyenv/Python 3.11 setup
- [x] `Roadmap/Roadmap.md` — v1.3 release, voice cloning marked complete

---

## ✅ Earlier Tasks (Morning)
- [x] **TTS Engine Swap**: Replaced Coqui XTTS (Python dependency hell) with Piper (Standalone Binary).
- [x] **Voice Model**: Downloaded `te_IN-maya-medium.onnx` to provide a natural Indian English accent.
- [x] **Brain Transplant**: Upgraded `core/brain.py` to use `llama3.1:8b`.
- [x] **Multilingual Ears**: Added "Context Priming" to Whisper in `core/adaptive_asr.py` to support phrases like *"Firefox open pannu"*.
- [x] **Tanglish Router**: Updated `core/router.py` regex to handle SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) sentence structures.
- [x] **Documentation**: Complete rewrite of the docs into an Obsidian-ready Knowledge Base.

## 🚧 Next Steps
- [ ] Record `speaker.wav` reference audio for voice cloning
- [ ] Test XTTS performance on RTX 3050
- [ ] Explore StyleTTS2 for emotional speech (Phase 4)

## 🧠 Decisions Made
- **Decision**: Implemented dual-engine TTS (XTTS + Piper)
    - *Reasoning*: XTTS v2 offers superior quality and voice cloning, but requires Python 3.11 and more resources. Piper remains as fast fallback.
- **Decision**: Migrated to Python 3.11 via pyenv
    - *Reasoning*: System Python 3.14 is too new for TTS library. pyenv allows project-specific Python versions.
- **Decision**: Dropped the "AI Router" (BERT) in favor of **Regex**.
    - *Reasoning*: The AI router added ~600ms latency. Regex is instant.
